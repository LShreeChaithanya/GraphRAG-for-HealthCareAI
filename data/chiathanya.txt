**Medical Report**
**Patient Name:** Chaithanya Kumar
**Age:** 52
**Gender:** Male
**Patient ID:** CH-2025-0087
**Date of Report:** 15-Aug-2025

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presents with complaints of persistent fatigue, excessive thirst (polydipsia), frequent urination (polyuria), and notable unintentional weight loss over the past three months. He reports episodes of blurred vision and tingling sensations in both feet. The patient states that these symptoms have progressively worsened despite ongoing treatment for diabetes.

**History of Present Illness:**
Mr. Chaithanya has been living with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for over 12 years. Over the past year, his glycemic control has deteriorated significantly. He admits to inconsistent blood glucose monitoring and occasional missed insulin doses due to work-related travel. Diet history reveals frequent consumption of high-glycemic foods and irregular meal timings. Over the last three months, the patient noticed a marked increase in thirst and urination, sometimes waking up 4–5 times at night to urinate. He also reports occasional dizziness and difficulty concentrating.

The patient denies fever, cough, or any recent infections, although he notes a small, non-healing sore on his left foot for the past two weeks. He describes intermittent numbness in his toes, especially after prolonged standing. These symptoms raise concerns for diabetic neuropathy and possible early vascular compromise.

**Past Medical History:**

* Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus — diagnosed in 2013, on oral hypoglycemic agents initially, transitioned to insulin therapy in 2019.
* Hypertension — diagnosed in 2017, on regular medication.
* Hyperlipidemia — diagnosed in 2020, on statin therapy.
* No known allergies.

**Family History:**
Strong family history of metabolic disorders. Father was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes at age 50 and died from diabetic kidney disease. Mother has hypertension and a history of angina. One elder brother has prediabetes; younger sister is reportedly healthy.

---

**Medications:**

* Metformin 1000 mg twice daily
* Insulin glargine 30 units at bedtime
* Rapid-acting insulin lispro 10 units before each major meal
* Amlodipine 5 mg daily
* Atorvastatin 20 mg nightly

---

**Physical Examination:**
The patient appears overweight with a BMI of 30.1 kg/m². He is alert and oriented but appears fatigued.

* **Vitals:** BP 148/92 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, RR 18/min, Temp 98.4°F.
* **Cardiovascular:** Regular rhythm, no murmurs.
* **Respiratory:** Clear breath sounds bilaterally.
* **Abdominal:** Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly.
* **Extremities:** Decreased sensation to light touch in toes and forefeet bilaterally. Small ulcer noted on plantar surface of left foot, measuring 1.5 cm, with mild surrounding erythema. Pedal pulses palpable but diminished.

**Laboratory Investigations:**

* **Fasting Plasma Glucose:** 232 mg/dL (Normal: <100 mg/dL)
* **Postprandial Glucose:** 321 mg/dL (Normal: <140 mg/dL)
* **HbA1c:** 11.4% (Normal: <5.7%) — indicates average blood glucose \~280 mg/dL over last 3 months.
* **Serum Creatinine:** 1.3 mg/dL (Normal: 0.7–1.2 mg/dL)
* **Urine Microalbumin:** 420 mg/g creatinine (Normal: <30 mg/g) — suggestive of early diabetic nephropathy.
* **Lipid Profile:**

  * Total Cholesterol: 232 mg/dL (High)
  * LDL-C: 152 mg/dL (High)
  * HDL-C: 34 mg/dL (Low)
  * Triglycerides: 228 mg/dL (High)

**Assessment:**
Mr. Chaithanya is a known case of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with severely uncontrolled glycemic levels despite insulin therapy. His elevated HbA1c, persistent hyperglycemia, and clinical symptoms are indicative of advanced disease with multiple complications, including peripheral neuropathy, early nephropathy, and heightened cardiovascular risk. His lipid profile shows significant dyslipidemia, further increasing the risk of macrovascular events.

The presence of a non-healing foot ulcer, diminished pedal pulses, and reduced sensation in the lower extremities are highly concerning for progression towards diabetic foot syndrome. The elevated urine microalbumin level suggests ongoing kidney damage that, if left unchecked, could progress to chronic kidney disease.

**Plan:**

1. Intensify insulin therapy — initiate full basal-bolus regimen with close titration.
2. Immediate wound care for left foot ulcer, including daily dressing and podiatry consult.
3. Begin ACE inhibitor therapy for renal protection.
4. Comprehensive dietary counseling — restrict refined carbohydrates, increase high-fiber foods, limit sodium to <2g/day.
5. Structured exercise plan — start with 30 minutes of moderate walking daily, gradually increasing as tolerated.
6. Arrange for diabetic education sessions focusing on glucose monitoring, foot care, and medication adherence.
7. Schedule follow-up in 4 weeks with repeat fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, and HbA1c in 3 months.
